### Steps to set up the environment for running locally

We assume that Python 3 and pip are installed and are accessible from path.  
If not please install [Python and pip](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then proceed to the steps below:  

- Downlaod the repository to your local machine.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the repository.
- Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django development server.
- Navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and start chatting!

Note - If python is not linked to Python 3, `runserver` will throw an error.
